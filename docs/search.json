    "text": "1 Introduction\n\n\n\nIf you could recognize this infamous cabbage man and his love for his cabbage, then it would be no surprise to you that the topic we chose to discuss was Avatar the Last Airbender.\nTo keep it brief to those who don’t know, Avatar the Last Airbender is a television series that focuses on a 12-year-old boy named Aang, who is the last surviving Air Nomad and Avatar who is destined to maintain the balance of the world and master all four elements: water, earth, fire, and air. However, due to a tragic event that led him to be trapped in ice for 100 years, he now has to embark on a journey, with the help of his friends, to find masters who can teach him to master the other three elements: water, earth, and fire. While doing so, he must also face the responsibility of defeating the Fire Nation to restore peace and balance to the world, as they have been stirring trouble and causing war with other nations, and are the reason why Aang is the last Air Nomad today.\nWith that, the reason to why we chose Avatar the Last Airbender as our topic is because we wanted to explore and analyze one of our favorite nostalgic TV shows growing up, as it taught us many important messages in our childhood such as empathy, kindness, love, acceptance, and much more. An example that demonstrates this is the following quote:\n\n\n\n“Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel. You can’t always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving… you will come to a better place.” — Uncle Iroh\nNot only that but given its rise in popularity again due to the Netflix Live Show adaptation, we thought this would be a good topic to explore as the show has caught many people’s attention again. Thus, some questions that we are interested in studying are the following:\n\nHow often does Aang speak in the show through each episode? Each season? Does his friends, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Zuko, begin to talk more than him?\nHow often does each pair of main characters interact with each other? For instance, how often does Aang interact with Katara, Sokka, Toph, or Zuko throughout the show? What about the others? How often does Katara interact with Sokka, Toph, Zuko, etc?\nDoes a particular main character’s appearance in the episode impact the IMDB Rating positively or negatively?\n\nAs for the reasons why we chose these type of questions, it is because not only were we interested in whether it would change our perspective or provide new insight into our favorite characters in the show, but we also hoped that it would do the same for the large fanbase for the show or for new incoming watchers starting the show.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe primary dataset for this project is sourced from the appa R package, created by Avery Robbins and available on GitHub (appa repository). The original data was scraped from two online sources: Avatar Wiki and IMDb. The appa GitHub repository includes the R scripts used to perform the web scraping, offering transparency in the data collection process.\nThe dataset is structured as a table containing 13,385 rows and 12 columns, where each row corresponds to a character line or a scene description from the TV show Avatar: The Last Airbender. Below are the variables and their descriptions:\nThe dataset was last updated on June 6, 2020. While the underlying content from the TV show remains unchanged since its conclusion in July 2008, IMDb ratings may have fluctuated over time due to ongoing audience reviews.\nAnother issue with the data is that the character column may list multiple characters in a single row. If we aim to measure which character speaks the most, this column will require additional preprocessing to split and appropriately attribute the dialogue to each individual character.\nAdditionally, if we want to create statistics based on character-specific attributes, such as age or gender, this information is not present in the dataset and will need to be obtained and integrated from an external source.\nTo access the data, users can install the appa R package from GitHub using the following commands:\nCode\ndevtools::install_github(\"averyrobbins1/appa\")\n\n\nUsing GitHub PAT from the git credential store.\n\n\nSkipping install of 'appa' from a github remote, the SHA1 (c7ce69d1) has not changed since last install.\n  Use `force = TRUE` to force installation\n\n\nCode\ndat &lt;- appa::appa",

In most cases, only character_words is missing, which suggests that there is no clear pattern connecting these missing values.\nHowever, as shown in the following graph, the missing values in character_words occur when no characters are speaking, and the full_text refers to a scene description rather than a dialogue.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(dat |&gt; group_by(character) |&gt; \n  summarise(Missing_dialogue=sum(is.na(character_words)/n())) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Missing_dialogue)) |&gt; \n  head(10),\n  aes(y=character,x=Missing_dialogue))+geom_col(fill=\"blue\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent,limits = c(0,1.05)) +\n  labs(x = \"Missing Dialogue (%)\", y = \"Character\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(Missing_dialogue)), \n            hjust = -0.1, color = \"black\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Top 10 Characters with Missing Dialogues\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the imdb_rating column, the next graph illustrates that the missing values correspond to only one episode.

The missing character_words values align with scene descriptions, which are not central to dialogue-based metrics, and the single missing imdb_rating affects only one episode, representing a negligible proportion of the data.",

    "text": "3.0.1 Does a particular main character’s appearance in the episode impact the IMDB Rating positively or negatively?\nSince we only have ratings per episode, one way to approach this question is to calculate the average rating for episodes where each character appears. However, this approach requires careful consideration to avoid two main issues:\nTo address these challenges, we applied the following filters to the data:\nAfter applying these filters, we produced the following graph:\nThe graph reveals that episodes where the two main antagonists of the show, Ozai and Azula, had significant relevance tend to have the highest ratings. This confirms the notion that a great antagonist is vital to a show’s success.\nAzula’s case is particularly noteworthy. Among the top five characters, she stands out as the only one with more than three relevant episodes. With seven episodes and the second-highest average rating, Azula demonstrates consistency, proving how much fans love to hate her.\nBut we can’t discuss Azula without mentioning her brother, Zuko—a fan favorite and the main cast member with the highest average rating. Over 27 episodes where Zuko was relevant, he achieved an impressive average rating of approximately 8.8.\nIn the middle of the graph, we find two other fan favorites, Toph and Iroh. While their averages are below 8.8, both characters maintained strong and consistent ratings across more than ten episodes in which they were relevant.\nAt the bottom of the graph, we see the three main characters. However, since they were relevant in almost every episode of the show, their averages reflect the overall show rating rather than individual character-driven ratings.\nExcluding the main characters, the episodes with the lowest fan ratings were those where Suki and Jet had significant relevance. Interestingly, both characters had romantic storylines with members of the main cast.",

What about the others? How often does Katara interact with Sokka, Toph, Zuko, etc?\n\n3.1.1 Top Interactions Throughout the Entire Show\n We define an interaction between a set of characters as occurring whenever they share a specific scene in the show. This metric allows us to quantify and highlight the most significant character dynamics throughout the series. As the graph illustrates, it’s no surprise that the original Team Avatar—Aang, Katara, and Sokka—leads with the highest number of interactions.\nOne notable observation is the presence of Iroh among the top interactions, despite not being part of the main cast. His inclusion highlights his pivotal role in the show, particularly through his relationship with Zuko, which is central to Zuko’s character arc.\n\n\n3.1.2 Top Interactions Per Book\n\n\n\nTop 10 Interactions Per Book\n\n\nIn this graph, we can see the evolution of Team Avatar, particularly the integration of Toph in the second book. Starting in the second book, the set of Aang, Katara, and Sokka began to share fewer scenes, and by the third book, the set with the most scenes became Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Toph.\nThe inclusion of Zuko into Team Avatar is less apparent, as it becomes increasingly challenging to have full scenes featuring five or more characters simultaneously. However, in the third book, we see him begin to interact more consistently with the rest of the main cast.\nNotably, the only two pairs of characters that remain in the top 10 interactions throughout the show are Aang and Katara, and Aang and Zuko. Even iconic interactions like Iroh and Zuko, as well as Katara and Sokka, do not make it into the top 10 by the third book.\n\n\n3.1.3 How often does each pair of main characters interact with each other?\nWhile measuring interactions between characters as sets is insightful—especially for observing team dynamics (as we did with Team Avatar)—it’s equally interesting to examine interactions between individual pairs of characters.\n\n\n\nInteractions between each pair of main characters\n\n\nThe graph shows how the main cast’s interactions evolved from primarily involving one or two characters in the first book to involving up to four by the third book. An exception is Zuko, who in the first book primarily interacted with his uncle Iroh but also had minor interactions with the rest of the main cast. In the second book, nearly all his interactions were limited to Iroh, but by the third book, his interactions with his uncle disappeared as he began consistently engaging with the rest of the main characters.\nAdditionally, we notice how the interactions among Aang, Katara, and Sokka remained consistently high throughout the series, even as their interactions expanded to include other characters in later seasons.\n\n\n3.1.4 Top Characters with the Most Solo Scenes\nWhile scenes with multiple characters are crucial, there are moments when the show focuses on a single character to drive the story or highlight personal growth. Here is the list of the top 10 characters with the most solo scenes:\n\n\n\nTop 10 Characters with the Most Solo Scenes\n\n\nAs expected, the main characters dominate the top 10. However, this graph also features new characters not previously highlighted, such as Piandao and Roku, who played significant roles in the episodes “Sokka’s Master” and “The Avatar and the Fire Lord”, respectively.",

    "text": "For Aang, the most important supportive character is Roku. Beyond being his past life, Roku serves as Aang’s mentor and guide throughout his journey. Since Roku can only be seen by Aang, he doesn’t appear in the interaction graphs of other characters.\nFor Katara, the most significant supportive character is Jet, which is expected. Not only is Jet one of the characters with the most episodes and lines in the show, but he also shares a special connection with Katara. Jet plays a pivotal role in Katara’s development, and we see him appear in other characters’ graphs, except for Zuko’s.\nFor Sokka, Suki stands out as the most important supportive character. This isn’t surprising, given that Suki is Sokka’s love interest. Additionally, since Suki eventually works with the Team Avatar, she appears in other graphs but is only relevant in Toph’s interactions.\nInterestingly, the most significant supportive character for Toph is also Suki. However, the number of interactions Toph has with Suki (16) is far fewer than Sokka’s interactions with Suki (50). This indicates that, unlike other main characters, Toph has very few interactions with characters outside the main cast.\nZuko has the highest number of interactions with a supportive character, with more than 100 interactions with his uncle Iroh. This is especially impressive considering their interactions stop in the third book, as previously mentioned. Iroh’s influence is so significant that he also appears in the graphs of other characters. Additionally, Azula is relevant to Zuko, with around 30 interactions. While Azula also appears in Toph’s graph, it is with only three interactions, leading us to conclude that Azula’s relevance is primarily tied to Zuko.",
