    "text": "1 Introduction\n\n\n\nIf you could recognize this infamous cabbage man and his love for his cabbages, then it would be no surprise to you that the topic we chose to discuss was Avatar the Last Airbender.\nTo keep it brief for those who don’t know, Avatar the Last Airbender is a television series that focuses on a 12-year-old boy named Aang, who is the last surviving Air Nomad and Avatar who is destined to maintain the balance of the world and master all four elements: water, earth, fire, and air. However, due to a tragic event that led him to be trapped in ice for 100 years, he now has to embark on a journey, with the help of his friends, to find masters who can teach him to master the other three elements: water, earth, and fire. While doing so, he must also face the responsibility of defeating the Fire Nation to restore peace and balance to the world, as they have been stirring trouble and causing war with other nations, and are the reason why Aang is the last Air Nomad today.\nWith that, the reason to why we chose Avatar the Last Airbender as our topic is because we wanted to explore and analyze one of our favorite nostalgic TV shows growing up, as it taught us many important messages in our childhood such as empathy, kindness, love, acceptance, and much more. An example that demonstrates this is the following quote:\n\n\n\n“Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel. You can’t always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving… you will come to a better place.” — Uncle Iroh\nNot only that but given its rise in popularity again due to the Netflix Live Show adaptation, we thought this would be a good topic to explore as the show has caught many people’s attention again. Thus, some questions that we are interested in studying are the following:\n\nHow often does Aang speak in the show? What about each season? Do his friends, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Zuko, begin to talk more than him?\nHow often does each pair of main characters interact with each other? For instance, how often does Aang interact with Katara, Sokka, Toph, or Zuko throughout the show? What about the others? How often does Katara interact with Sokka, Toph, Zuko, etc?\nDoes a particular main character’s appearance in the episode impact the IMDB Rating positively or negatively?\n\nAs for the reasons why we chose these types of questions, we did so for mainly two reasons:\n\nWe were interested in whether this would change our perspective or provide new insight into our favorite characters from the show and\nWe hoped these questions would do the same for the show’s large fanbase and new incoming watchers starting the show.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe primary dataset for this project is sourced from the appa R package, created by Avery Robbins and available on GitHub (appa repository). The original data was scraped from two online sources: Avatar Wiki and IMDb. The appa GitHub repository includes the R scripts used to perform the web scraping, offering transparency in the data collection process.\nThe dataset is structured as a table containing 13,385 rows and 12 columns, where each row corresponds to a character line or a scene description from the TV show Avatar: The Last Airbender. Below are the variables and their descriptions:\nThe dataset was last updated on June 6, 2020. While the underlying content from the TV show remains unchanged since its conclusion in July 2008, IMDb ratings may have fluctuated over time due to ongoing audience reviews.\nAnother issue with the data is that the character column may list multiple characters in a single row. If we aim to measure which character speaks the most, this column will require additional preprocessing to split and appropriately attribute the dialogue to each individual character.\nAdditionally, if we want to create statistics based on character-specific attributes, such as age or gender, this information is not present in the dataset and will need to be obtained and integrated from an external source.\nTo access the data, users can install the appa R package from GitHub using the following commands:\nCode\ndevtools::install_github(\"averyrobbins1/appa\")\n\n\nUsing GitHub PAT from the git credential store.\n\n\nSkipping install of 'appa' from a github remote, the SHA1 (c7ce69d1) has not changed since last install.\n  Use `force = TRUE` to force installation\n\n\nCode\ndat &lt;- appa::appa",

    "section": "",
    "text": "3.1.1 How often does Aang speak in the show?\nTo begin our analysis on the appa R package data set created by Avery Robbins, we decided first to explore the question of “How often does Aang speak in the show? What about each season? Do his friends, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Zuko, begin to talk more than him?” To do this, we decided to get the total amount of dialogue spoken by every character throughout the show and focused only on the top 10, as there were over 300 characters, including the supporting and background characters.\n\n\n\nThe Top 10 Avatar the Last Airbender Characters with the Most Dialogues/Lines\n\n\nWith no surprise, the main characters in Team Avatar, Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Zuko, were among the top 10 with the most dialogues/lines throughout the show, where Aang had the most dialogue of about 25%. Thus, answering the first part of our question of how often Aang speaks throughout the show. Additionally, we can see that the male characters in Team Avatar spoke way more than the female characters where the males spoke about 68% of the time in Team Avatar, whereas the females spoke about 32%. Lastly, we can see important characters like Iroh, Azula, and Suki were among the top 10, which makes sense as each played a significant role in some member’s development in Team Avatar.\nHowever, one thing about this graph that caught our attention was that side characters like Zhao and Jet were among the top 10. This piqued our interest as we recall them appearing infrequently in the show. As a result, this made us curious where we decided to see how many episodes each of these top 10 characters with the most dialogues/lines were in.\n\n3.1.1.1 Top 10 Avatar the Last Airbender Character with the Most Dialogue Episode Appearances\n\n\n\nTotal Amount of Episodes Top 10 Character Were In\n\n\nAs you can see, our suspicions about Zhao and Jet appearing infrequently in the show were correct. Despite Jet only appearing in 5 and Zhao appearing in 7 episodes, they still made it among the top 10. What’s even more interesting is that we can see characters like Suki, who appeared in more episodes than Jet, had fewer dialogues than him by a small amount. Similarly, we can see the same case for Toph and Uncle Iroh. Despite Iroh appearing slightly slightly more in episodes, Toph still had about 200 more dialogue than him. This was quite a surprise as we expected Iroh to have more given the many life lessons and quotes he gives to the members of team Avatar, especially Zuko.\nBy using the following two graphs together, we can see that the majority of the top 10 characters with the most dialogues/lines throughout the show are the one who often appear in episodes. This can be seen for Aang, Sokka, Katara, and Zuko, as they remain in the top 4 in both graphs in the same order. Furthermore, with the help of both graphs, we can see a few exceptional cases where some of the top 10 characters appearing in fewer episodes have more dialogues than those who appear often.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Top Characters with the Most Solo Scenes\nThis naturally led us to wonder not only about the frequency of dialogue but also about the moments when these characters were given the spotlight on their own. To explore this further, we analyzed the top characters with the most solo scenes, as these moments often reveal critical aspects of their personalities and contributions to the story. Here’s what we found:\n\n\n\nTop 10 Characters with the Most Solo Scenes\n\n\nAs expected, the main characters dominate the top 10. However, this graph also features new characters not previously highlighted, such as Piandao and Roku, who played significant roles in the episodes “Sokka’s Master” and “The Avatar and the Fire Lord”, respectively.\n\n\n3.1.3 What about each season? Do his friends, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Zuko, begin to talk more than him?\n\n\n\nTop 10 Character Dialogue/Lines Per Book\n\n\nHaving answered the first question of how often Aang speaks in the show, to answer the second part of our question of how much he speaks per season, we decided to keep the top 10 characters with the most dialogue and found the frequency of each per season. From this, we can see that Aang speaks less per season. Starting from the Water Book Chapter, he had a marginal amount of dialogue compared to all the other top 10 characters, where he had more than 150 lines than Katara, who was number 2. However, this began to change during the Earth Book Chapter, where his dialogue dropped by 300, leading Sokka to overtake him in both the Earth and Fire Book Chapter. Thus, answering our second part where, among the members of Team Avatar, only Sokka began to talk more than Aang.\nAlthough this graph was mainly created to help answer the second part of the question, it still is really meaningful as it also allows us to observe how important each character becomes and their roles during each season. For instance, we can see that Zhao had a pretty important role during the Water Book Chapter but not the Earth and Fire Book Chapter, as his number of dialogues dropped to 0. Another example that we can see from the graph is the rising importance of Toph, Zuko, and Suki towards the show as their number of dialogues began to increase each season.",

    "text": "3.2 What are the trends of IMDb ratings throughout the show?\n\n3.2.1 IMDb Ratings Trend Per Book Chapter\nTo discover if there are any trends regarding IMDb ratings for the show, we first grabbed all the episode names, episode number,and their IMDb rating where we then faceted over their respective book or season and got the following:\n\n\n\nIMDb Rating of each episode Per Chapter Book\n\n\nFrom this, we can see the trend of each episode with respect to their chapter book. Starting with Water Book or Season 1, we can see a lot of fluctuation going on where in the first 7 episodes, it was consistent where it was between 8 - 8.5 IMDb rating. Afterward, it kept going up and down from episodes 8-17 between 7 - 9.1, and then, for the last few episodes, it went up slowly to 9.3. Unfortunately, as mentioned in the “Missing” section, we are missing one episode, which is the last episode in the water book chapter.\nNext, Earth Book or Season 2, starts with a lot of fluctuation for the first 12 episodes, with a rating between 7.5 and 9.5. Afterward, the fluctuation becomes slowly consistent, where it jumps up and down each episode, leading to the last episode having an IMDb rating of 9.6. Lastly, Fire Book or Season 3, goes through way more fluctuation compared to the first two season where the first 17 episodes drastically keeps jumping from rating between 7.8 and 9.5. However, this began to change in the last 4 episodes, where the fluctuation then began to only increase, leading the last episode to have a 9.8 rating.\nOverall, these three-faceted graphs are helpful for those curious to see rating fluctuation for each book chapter and to see each episode’s impact on each book chapter as well. The only downside is that comparing episode ratings with other episodes in different chapters can be challenging despite the three-faceted graphs being on the same scale.\n\n\n3.2.2 IMDb Ratings of all Episodes Colored by Book Chapter\n To resolve the above graph challenge of comparing episode ratings with other Book Chapters, we created a Cleveland dot plot where we displayed all the episode names, sorted them based on the IMDb rating in descending order, and colored each one to their corresponding chapter. With this, we can now easily compare all episodes in each season simultaneously.\nFor example, we can see that most episodes with higher IMDb ratings come from the Fire Book Chapter, whereas episodes with lower IMDb ratings come from the Water Book Chapter. Furthermore, we can see that episodes from the Earth Book Chapter had evenly distributed IMDb ratings. Some were in the lower end with episodes from the Water Book Chapter, some were in the middle, and some were in the higher end with episodes from the Fire Book Chapter. Lastly, we can see gradual changes in the IMDb rating, which generally increases as we progress through each chapter, from Water to Earth and then Fire, indicating improvement in the story as it begins to capture more of the audience’s or viewers’ attention.\nAll in all, with the help of the Cleveland Dot plot, we were able to quickly form comparisons regarding all the episode IMDB ratings in each book chapter and gain further observation and insight about them, which would not have been possible or rather tricky with just the three-faceted graph alone.\n\n\n3.2.3 Does a particular main character’s appearance in the episode impact the IMDB Rating positively or negatively?\nSince we only have ratings per episode, one way to approach this question is to calculate the average rating for episodes where each character appears. However, this approach requires careful consideration to avoid two main issues:\n\nBackground Characters: Many minor characters may appear only once in a highly-rated episode. Even if they are irrelevant to the plot, their presence would be associated with a very high score.\nLimited Appearances: Even if a character is crucial to an exceptional episode, if they appear in only one episode, it’s difficult to conclude that the high rating is directly because of them.\n\nTo address these challenges, we applied the following filters to the data:\n\nCharacter Frequency: We only considered characters who were relevant in more than one episode.\nDefining Relevance: A character was deemed relevant in an episode if they had at least 15 participations in that episode. This threshold was chosen because the average number of participations for main characters in an episode ranges between 17 and 35.\n\nAfter applying these filters, we produced the following graph:\n\n\n\nAverage IMDb Rating for characters\n\n\nThe graph reveals that episodes where the two main antagonists of the show, Ozai and Azula, had significant relevance tend to have the highest ratings. This confirms the notion that a great antagonist is vital to a show’s success.\nAzula’s case is particularly noteworthy. Among the top five characters, she stands out as the only one with more than three relevant episodes. With seven episodes and the second-highest average rating, Azula demonstrates consistency, proving how much fans love to hate her.\nBut we can’t discuss Azula without mentioning her brother, Zuko—a fan favorite and the main cast member with the highest average rating. Over 27 episodes where Zuko was relevant, he achieved an impressive average rating of approximately 8.8.\nIn the middle of the graph, we find two other fan favorites, Toph and Iroh. While their averages are below 8.8, both characters maintained strong and consistent ratings across more than ten episodes in which they were relevant.\nAt the bottom of the graph, we see the three main characters. However, since they were relevant in almost every episode of the show, their averages reflect the overall show rating rather than individual character-driven ratings.\nExcluding the main characters, the episodes with the lowest fan ratings were those where Suki and Jet had significant relevance. Interestingly, both characters had romantic storylines with members of the main cast.",

What about the others? How often does Katara interact with Sokka, Toph, Zuko, etc?\n\n3.3.1 Top Interactions Throughout the Entire Show\n\n\n\nTop 10 Interactions Throughout Entire Show\n\n\nWe define an interaction between a set of characters as occurring whenever they share a specific scene in the show. This metric allows us to quantify and highlight the most significant character dynamics throughout the series. As the graph illustrates, it’s no surprise that the original Team Avatar—Aang, Katara, and Sokka—leads with the highest number of interactions.\nWhen analyzing the interactions between male and female members of Team Avatar, we notice some differences that may be attributed to several factors. For instance, the number of interactions involving the male characters Aang and Sokka is around 250, while the interactions between Katara and Toph are approximately 100—less than half. One key reason for this disparity is the inclusion of Toph, who joined the team in the second book, shifting the dynamic. Additionally, if we recall the show, the relationship between Katara and Toph was initially strained. Their contrasting personalities and frequent disagreements in the beginning made their bond slower to develop compared to the already strong relationships within the original trio.\nOne notable observation is the presence of Iroh among the top interactions, despite not being part of the main cast. His inclusion highlights his pivotal role in the show, particularly through his relationship with Zuko, which is central to Zuko’s character arc.\n\n\n3.3.2 Top Interactions Per Book\n\n\n\nTop 10 Interactions Per Book\n\n\nIn this graph, we can see the evolution of Team Avatar, particularly the integration of Toph in the second book. Starting in the second book, the set of Aang, Katara, and Sokka began to share fewer scenes, and by the third book, the set with the most scenes became Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Toph.\nThe inclusion of Zuko into Team Avatar is less apparent, as it becomes increasingly challenging to have full scenes featuring five or more characters simultaneously. However, in the third book, we see him begin to interact more consistently with the rest of the main cast.\nNotably, the only two pairs of characters that remain in the top 10 interactions throughout the show are Aang and Katara, and Aang and Zuko. Even iconic interactions like Iroh and Zuko, as well as Katara and Sokka, do not make it into the top 10 by the third book.\n\n\n3.3.3 How often does each pair of main characters interact with each other?\nWhile measuring interactions between characters as sets is insightful—especially for observing team dynamics (as we did with Team Avatar)—it’s equally interesting to examine interactions between individual pairs of characters.\n\n\n\nInteractions between each pair of main characters\n\n\nThe graph shows how the main cast’s interactions evolved from primarily involving one or two characters in the first book to involving up to four by the third book. An exception is Zuko, who in the first book primarily interacted with his uncle Iroh but also had minor interactions with the rest of the main cast. In the second book, nearly all his interactions were limited to Iroh, but by the third book, his interactions with his uncle disappeared as he began consistently engaging with the rest of the main characters.\nAdditionally, we notice how the interactions among Aang, Katara, and Sokka remained consistently high throughout the series, even as their interactions expanded to include other characters in later seasons.",

Since Roku can only be seen by Aang, he doesn’t appear in the interaction graphs of other characters.\nFor Katara, the most significant supportive character is Jet, which is expected. Not only is Jet one of the characters with the most episodes and lines in the show, but he also shares a special connection with Katara. Jet plays a pivotal role in Katara’s development, and we see him appear in other characters’ graphs, except for Zuko’s.\nFor Sokka, Suki stands out as the most important supportive character. This isn’t surprising, given that Suki is Sokka’s love interest. Additionally, since Suki eventually works with the Team Avatar, she appears in other graphs but is only relevant in Toph’s interactions.\nInterestingly, the most significant supportive character for Toph is also Suki. However, the number of interactions Toph has with Suki (16) is far fewer than Sokka’s interactions with Suki (50). This indicates that, unlike other main characters, Toph has very few interactions with characters outside the main cast.\nZuko has the highest number of interactions with a supportive character, with more than 100 interactions with his uncle Iroh. This is especially impressive considering their interactions stop in the third book, as previously mentioned. Iroh’s influence is so significant that he also appears in the graphs of other characters. Additionally, Azula is relevant to Zuko, with around 30 interactions. While Azula also appears in Toph’s graph, it is with only three interactions, leading us to conclude that Azula’s relevance is primarily tied to Zuko.",

However, this caused issues as many of the texts overlapped one another, given how close each line was, and made some texts appear in the middle of the graph.\nAdditionally, to help improve color readability, we tried to find a better qualitative color set from the RColorBrewer package, where we found only two color pallets that can support more than 10 colors: “Paired” and “Set3”. Unfortunately, this did not help, as the colors used from the two pallets were still challenging to read and did not correlate well with our categorical “characters” variable. As a result, we decided to use the default colors from ggplot2.\nBelow is our attempt to do so:\n\n\n\nTop 10 Characters with the Most Lines per Book Chapter (Fail Version)\n\n\n\n\n5.2.1.2 “Average Ratings for Characters with Over 15 Appearances Per Episodes” Graph\nFor the “Average Ratings for Characters with Over 15 Appearances Per Episodes” graph Section 3.2.3, to help improve the interpretability of the circle size, we thought using different shapes or setting labels may help. Although we were successful in doing so, we were conflicted about these changes.\nFor the different shapes, we were debating whether this would help or make the reader more confused with the various shapes involved. For the labels, although it was clear what each circle represented, it added too much unnecessary text to the graph, making it messy. As a result, this led us to choose the original graph design.\nBelow is the additional graph design created:\n\n\n\nAverage IMDb Rating for characters (Shape Version )\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage IMDb Rating for characters (Label Version )\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 D3 Issues\n\n5.2.2.1 File Relative Path\nTo properly load the multiple CSV data files we created for the interactive graph, which will work on all branches, we wanted to use a file relative path instead of a full hardcoded URL path that was branch-dependent. However, this method did not work given how the QMD notebook is rendered and will require modification to the YAML file to make it work properly. Thus, a workaround instead was to read the current branch name and embed it in the URL so that it could properly make the API call to the data file directory.",

    "text": "5.3 Future Direction\nGiven our limited time constraints, one future direction we would have liked to consider is finding another dataset that works well with this dataset containing information to further expand our exploration. For example, a dataset that includes the following category:\n\nHaving each character’s gender\nLocation of where characters were during the episodes\nRatings from another rating platform besides IMDb\nThe total number of people who participated in those ratings, or\nFan favorite characters\n\nAnother future direction is possibly comparing our exploration to Legend of Korra, as it is the sequel to Avatar the Last Airbender. Therefore, we can see if the two shows are entirely different or similar as they were animated in the same universe.",

    "text": "5.4 Lessons Learned\nHaving spent a generous amount of time exploring and learning the capability of this data set, along with the visualization that we created towards the questions we wanted to explore, the main lessons that we learned were:\n\nHow powerful and purposeful graphs can be, as they can lead to many new profound questions and curiosity along the way. For instance, we did not initially plan to look at episode appearances for each character. However, that changed after seeing the results of the total amount of dialogues each character had, leading us to expand from there and discover more analysis on the importance and impact of each character. The same case for our exploration on interactivity between each character in the show.\nRefraining our under-estimation of dense datasets with limited column amounts. Initially, we thought we should increase the number of columns for this data set as it may make our analysis generic and bland. However, this was not the case, as we were able to dive even more deeply than expected as we initially thought of including graphs of the show’s directors and whether they influenced the show’s success. But that was not needed, given our curiosity towards learning more about our initial questions.",
