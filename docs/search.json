    "text": "1 Introduction\n\n\n\nIf you could recognize this infamous cabbage man and his love for his cabbage, then it would be no surprise to you that the topic we chose to discuss was Avatar the Last Airbender.\nTo keep it brief to those who don’t know, Avatar the Last Airbender is a television series that focuses on a 12-year-old boy named Aang, who is the last surviving Air Nomad and Avatar who is destined to maintain the balance of the world and master all four elements: water, earth, fire, and air. However, due to a tragic event that led him to be trapped in ice for 100 years, he now has to embark on a journey, with the help of his friends, to find masters who can teach him to master the other three elements: water, earth, and fire. While doing so, he must also face the responsibility of defeating the Fire Nation to restore peace and balance to the world, as they have been stirring trouble and causing war with other nations, and are the reason why Aang is the last Air Nomad today.\nWith that, the reason to why we chose Avatar the Last Airbender as our topic is because we wanted to explore and analyze one of our favorite nostalgic TV shows growing up, as it taught us many important messages in our childhood such as empathy, kindness, love, acceptance, and much more. An example that demonstrates this is the following quote:\n\n\n\n“Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel. You can’t always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving… you will come to a better place.” — Uncle Iroh\nNot only that but given its rise in popularity again due to the Netflix Live Show adaptation, we thought this would be a good topic to explore as the show has caught many people’s attention again. Thus, some questions that we are interested in studying are the following:\n\nHow often does Aang speak in the show? What about each season? Does his friends, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Zuko, begin to talk more than him?\nHow often does each pair of main characters interact with each other? For instance, how often does Aang interact with Katara, Sokka, Toph, or Zuko throughout the show? What about the others? How often does Katara interact with Sokka, Toph, Zuko, etc?\nDoes a particular main character’s appearance in the episode impact the IMDB Rating positively or negatively?\n\nAs for the reasons why we chose these type of questions, it is because not only were we interested in whether it would change our perspective or provide new insight into our favorite characters in the show, but we also hoped that it would do the same for the large fanbase for the show or for new incoming watchers starting the show.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe primary dataset for this project is sourced from the appa R package, created by Avery Robbins and available on GitHub (appa repository). The original data was scraped from two online sources: Avatar Wiki and IMDb. The appa GitHub repository includes the R scripts used to perform the web scraping, offering transparency in the data collection process.\nThe dataset is structured as a table containing 13,385 rows and 12 columns, where each row corresponds to a character line or a scene description from the TV show Avatar: The Last Airbender. Below are the variables and their descriptions:\nThe dataset was last updated on June 6, 2020. While the underlying content from the TV show remains unchanged since its conclusion in July 2008, IMDb ratings may have fluctuated over time due to ongoing audience reviews.\nAnother issue with the data is that the character column may list multiple characters in a single row. If we aim to measure which character speaks the most, this column will require additional preprocessing to split and appropriately attribute the dialogue to each individual character.\nAdditionally, if we want to create statistics based on character-specific attributes, such as age or gender, this information is not present in the dataset and will need to be obtained and integrated from an external source.\nTo access the data, users can install the appa R package from GitHub using the following commands:\nCode\ndevtools::install_github(\"averyrobbins1/appa\")\n\n\nUsing GitHub PAT from the git credential store.\n\n\nSkipping install of 'appa' from a github remote, the SHA1 (c7ce69d1) has not changed since last install.\n  Use `force = TRUE` to force installation\n\n\nCode\ndat &lt;- appa::appa",

In most cases, only character_words is missing, which suggests that there is no clear pattern connecting these missing values.\nHowever, as shown in the following graph, the missing values in character_words occur when no characters are speaking, and the full_text refers to a scene description rather than a dialogue.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(dat |&gt; group_by(character) |&gt; \n  summarise(Missing_dialogue=sum(is.na(character_words)/n())) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Missing_dialogue)) |&gt; \n  head(10),\n  aes(y=character,x=Missing_dialogue))+geom_col(fill=\"blue\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent,limits = c(0,1.05)) +\n  labs(x = \"Missing Dialogue (%)\", y = \"Character\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(Missing_dialogue)), \n            hjust = -0.1, color = \"black\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Top 10 Characters with Missing Dialogues\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the imdb_rating column, the next graph illustrates that the missing values correspond to only one episode. This explains why the proportion of missing values in imdb_rating is very small in the initial graph.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(dat |&gt; group_by(chapter) |&gt; \n  summarise(Missing_rating=sum(is.na(imdb_rating)/n())) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Missing_rating)) |&gt; \n  head(10),\n  aes(y=chapter,x=Missing_rating))+geom_col(fill=\"blue\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent,limits = c(0,1.05)) +\n  labs(x = \"Missing Rating (%)\", y = \"Episode\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(Missing_rating)), \n            hjust = -0.1, color = \"black\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Top 10 Episodes without IMDb Rating\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, these missing values are unlikely to significantly impact our analysis. The missing character_words values align with scene descriptions, which are not central to dialogue-based metrics, and the single missing imdb_rating affects only one episode, representing a negligible proportion of the data.",

    "text": "3.1.1 How often does Aang speak in the show?\nTo begin our analysis on the appa R package data set created by Avery Robbins, we decided first to explore the question of “How often does Aang speak in the show? What about each season? Does his friends, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Zuko, begin to talk more than him?” To do this, we decided to get the total amount of dialogue spoken by every character throughout the show and focused only on the top 10, as there were over 300 characters, including the supporting and background characters.\n\n\n\nThe Top 10 Avatar the Last Airbender Characters with the Most Dialogues/Lines\n\n\nWith no surprise, the main characters in Team Avatar, Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Zuko, were among the top 10 with the most dialogues/lines throughout the show, where Aang had the most dialogue of about 25%. Thus, answering the first part of our question of how often Aang speaks throughout the show. Additionally, we can see that the male characters in Team Avatar spoke way more than the female characters. The males spoke about 68% of the time in Team Avatar, whereas the females spoke about 32%. Lastly, we can see important characters like Iroh, Azula, and Suki were among the top 10, which makes sense as each played a significant role in some member’s development in Team Avatar.\nHowever, one thing about this graph that caught our attention was that side characters like Zhao and Jet were among the top 10. This piqued our interest as we recall them appearing infrequently in the show. As a result, this made us curious where we decided to see how many episodes each of these top 10 characters with the most dialogues/lines were in.\n\n3.1.1.1 Top 10 Avatar the Last Airbender Character with the Most Dialogue Episode Appearances\n\n\n\nTotal Amount of Episodes Top 10 Character Were In\n\n\nAs you can see, our suspicions about Zhao and Jet appearing infrequently in the show were correct. Despite Jet only appearing in 5 and Zhao appearing in 7 episodes, they still made it among the top 10. What’s even more interesting is that we can see characters like Suki, who appeared in more episodes than Jet, had fewer dialogues than him by a small amount. Similarly, we can see the same case for Toph and Uncle Iroh. Despite Iroh appearing slightly slightly more in episodes, Toph still had about 200 more dialogue than him. This was quite a surprise as we expected Iroh to have more given the many life lessons and quotes he gives to the members of team Avatar, especially Zuko.\nAll in all, by using the following two graphs together, we can see that the majority of the top 10 characters with the most dialogues/lines throughout the show are the one who often appear in episodes. This can be seen for Aang, Sokka, Katara, and Zuko, as they remain in the top 4 in both graphs in the same order. Furthermore, with the help of both graphs, we can see a few exceptional cases where some of the top 10 characters appearing in fewer episodes have more dialogues than those who appear often.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 What about each season?

    "text": "3.2 What are the trends of IMDb ratings throughout the show?\n\n3.2.1 IMDb Ratings Trend Per Book Chapter\nTo discover if there are any trends regarding IMDb ratings for the show, we first grabbed all the episode names, episode number,and their IMDb rating where we then faceted over their respective book or season and got the following:\n\n\n\nIMDb Rating of each episode Per Chapter Book\n\n\nFrom this, we can see the trend of each episode with respect to their chapter book. Starting with Water Book or Season 1, we can see a lot of fluctuation going on where in the first 7 episodes, it was consistent where it was between 8 - 8.5 IMDb rating. Afterward, it kept going up and down from episodes 8-17 between 7 - 9.1, and then, for the last few episodes, it went up slowly to 9.3. Unfortunately, as mentioned in the “Missing” section, we are missing one episode, which is the last episode in the water book chapter.\nNext, Earth Book or Season 2, starts with a lot of fluctuation for the first 12 episodes, with a rating between 7.5 and 9.5. Afterward, the fluctuation becomes slowly consistent, where it jumps up and down each episode, leading to the last episode having an IMDb rating of 9.6. Lastly, Fire Book or Season 3, goes through way more fluctuation compared to the first two season where the first 17 episodes drastically keeps jumping from rating between 7.8 and 9.5. However, this began to change in the last 4 episodes, where the fluctuation then began to only increase, leading the last episode to have a 9.8 rating.\nOverall, these three-faceted graphs are helpful for those curious to see rating fluctuation for each book chapter and to see each episode’s impact on each book chapter as well. The only downside is that comparing episode ratings with other episodes in different chapters can be challenging despite the three-faceted graphs being on the same scale.\n\n\n3.2.2 IMDb Ratings of all Episodes Colored by Book Chapter\n\n\n\nIMDb Rating of all Episodes in Order\n\n\nTo resolve the above graph challenge of comparing episode ratings with other Book Chapters, we created a Cleveland dot plot where we displayed all the episode names, sorted them based on the IMDb rating in descending order, and colored each one to their corresponding chapter. With this, we can now easily compare all episodes in each season simultaneously.\nFor example, we can see that most episodes with higher IMDb ratings come from the Fire Book Chapter, whereas episodes with lower IMDb ratings come from the Water Book Chapter. Furthermore, we can see that episodes from the Earth Book Chapter had evenly distributed IMDb ratings. Some were in the lower end with episodes from the Water Book Chapter, some were in the middle, and some were in the higher end with episodes from the Fire Book Chapter. Lastly, we can see gradual changes in the IMDb rating, which generally increases as we progress through each chapter, from Water to Earth and then Fire, indicating improvement in the story as it begins to capture more of the audience’s or viewers’ attention.\nAll in all, with the help of the Cleveland Dot plot, we were able to quickly form comparisons regarding all the episode IMDB ratings in each book chapter and gain further observation and insight about them, which would not have been possible or rather tricky with just the three-faceted graph alone.",
