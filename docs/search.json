    "text": "1 Introduction\n\n\n\nIf you could recognize this infamous cabbage man and his love for his cabbage, then it would be no surprise to you that the topic we chose to discuss was Avatar the Last Airbender.\nTo keep it brief to those who don’t know, Avatar the Last Airbender is a television series that focuses on a 12-year-old boy named Aang, who is the last surviving Air Nomad and Avatar who is destined to maintain the balance of the world and master all four elements: water, earth, fire, and air. However, due to a tragic event that led him to be trapped in ice for 100 years, he now has to embark on a journey, with the help of his friends, to find masters who can teach him to master the other three elements: water, earth, and fire. While doing so, he must also face the responsibility of defeating the Fire Nation to restore peace and balance to the world, as they have been stirring trouble and causing war with other nations, and are the reason why Aang is the last Air Nomad today.\nWith that, the reason to why we chose Avatar the Last Airbender as our topic is because we wanted to explore and analyze one of our favorite nostalgic TV shows growing up, as it taught us many important messages in our childhood such as empathy, kindness, love, acceptance, and much more. An example that demonstrates this is the following quote:\n\n\n\n“Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel. You can’t always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving… you will come to a better place.” — Uncle Iroh\nNot only that but given its rise in popularity again due to the Netflix Live Show adaptation, we thought this would be a good topic to explore as the show has caught many people’s attention again. Thus, some questions that we are interested in studying are the following:\n\nHow often does Aang speak in the show through each episode? Each season? Does his friends, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Zuko, begin to talk more than him?\nHow often does each pair of main characters interact with each other? For instance, how often does Aang interact with Katara, Sokka, Toph, or Zuko throughout the show? What about the others? How often does Katara interact with Sokka, Toph, Zuko, etc?\nDoes a particular main character’s appearance in the episode impact the IMDB Rating positively or negatively?\n\nAs for the reasons why we chose these type of questions, it is because not only were we interested in whether it would change our perspective or provide new insight into our favorite characters in the show, but we also hoped that it would do the same for the large fanbase for the show or for new incoming watchers starting the show.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe primary dataset for this project is sourced from the appa R package, created by Avery Robbins and available on GitHub (appa repository). The original data was scraped from two online sources: Avatar Wiki and IMDb. The appa GitHub repository includes the R scripts used to perform the web scraping, offering transparency in the data collection process.\nThe dataset is structured as a table containing 13,385 rows and 12 columns, where each row corresponds to a character line or a scene description from the TV show Avatar: The Last Airbender. Below are the variables and their descriptions:\nThe dataset was last updated on June 6, 2020. While the underlying content from the TV show remains unchanged since its conclusion in July 2008, IMDb ratings may have fluctuated over time due to ongoing audience reviews.\nAnother issue with the data is that the character column may list multiple characters in a single row. If we aim to measure which character speaks the most, this column will require additional preprocessing to split and appropriately attribute the dialogue to each individual character.\nAdditionally, if we want to create statistics based on character-specific attributes, such as age or gender, this information is not present in the dataset and will need to be obtained and integrated from an external source.\nTo access the data, users can install the appa R package from GitHub using the following commands:\nCode\ndevtools::install_github(\"averyrobbins1/appa\")\n\n\nUsing GitHub PAT from the git credential store.\n\n\nSkipping install of 'appa' from a github remote, the SHA1 (c7ce69d1) has not changed since last install.\n  Use `force = TRUE` to force installation\n\n\nCode\ndat &lt;- appa::appa",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(redav)\ndat &lt;- appa::appa\nplot_missing(dat,max_cols = 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the missing values appear only in two columns: character_words and imdb_rating. In most cases, only character_words is missing, which suggests that there is no clear pattern connecting these missing values.\nHowever, as shown in the following graph, the missing values in character_words occur when no characters are speaking, and the full_text refers to a scene description rather than a dialogue.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(dat |&gt; group_by(character) |&gt; \n  summarise(Missing_dialogue=sum(is.na(character_words)/n())) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Missing_dialogue)) |&gt; \n  head(10),\n  aes(y=character,x=Missing_dialogue))+geom_col(fill=\"blue\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent,limits = c(0,1.05)) +\n  labs(x = \"Missing Dialogue (%)\", y = \"Character\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(Missing_dialogue)), \n            hjust = -0.1, color = \"black\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Top 10 Characters with Missing Dialogues\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the imdb_rating column, the next graph illustrates that the missing values correspond to only one episode. This explains why the proportion of missing values in imdb_rating is very small in the initial graph.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(dat |&gt; group_by(chapter) |&gt; \n  summarise(Missing_rating=sum(is.na(imdb_rating)/n())) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Missing_rating)) |&gt; \n  head(10),\n  aes(y=chapter,x=Missing_rating))+geom_col(fill=\"blue\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent,limits = c(0,1.05)) +\n  labs(x = \"Missing Rating (%)\", y = \"Episode\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(Missing_rating)), \n            hjust = -0.1, color = \"black\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Top 10 Episodes without IMDb Rating\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, these missing values are unlikely to significantly impact our analysis. The missing character_words values align with scene descriptions, which are not central to dialogue-based metrics, and the single missing imdb_rating affects only one episode, representing a negligible proportion of the data.",
