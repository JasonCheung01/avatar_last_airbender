To those who don’t know what Avatar the Last Airbender is, it is a show that follows a 13-year-old boy named Aang, who is the last surviving Air Nomad and Avatar, who has the power to control all elements. However, unable to master each of these elements fully before the loss of all predecessor Avatars, he now must learn how to master each of them entirely on his own with the help of his friends. Additionally, while doing so, he must face the responsibility of restoring balance to the world by defeating the Fire nation who have launched a century-long assault against other nations, which is a lot to take in and do for a 13-year-old boy.\nWith that, we chose Avatar the Last Airbender as our topic because we wanted to explore and analyze one of our favorite nostalgic TV shows growing up, as it taught us many important messages in our childhood such as empathy, kindness, love, acceptance, and much more. For instance,\n\n\n\n“Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel. You can’t always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving… you will come to a better place.” — Uncle Iroh\nNot only that, but given its rise in popularity again due to Netflix Live Show adaptation, we figured this was the best time to explore as it now caught many people’s attention again, and we hope that our analysis will help answer any questions or provide new insights to those watching. With that, the questions that we are interested in studying are the following:\n\nWhich characters spoke the most in the show?\n\nAverage word spoken each episode?\n\nWhich gender had the most lines/word?\n\nHow often do these characters appear through the show?\n\nHow much they appear per season?\n\nWhich episodes/seasons had the highest IMDB rating?",
