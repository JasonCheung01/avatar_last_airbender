    "text": "1 Introduction\n\n\n\nIf you could recognize this infamous cabbage man and his love for his cabbage, then it would be no surprise to you that the topic we chose to discuss was Avatar the Last Airbender.\nTo keep it brief to those who don’t know, Avatar the Last Airbender is a television series that focuses on a 12-year-old boy named Aang, who is the last surviving Air Nomad and Avatar who is destined to maintain the balance of the world and master all four elements: water, earth, fire, and air. However, due to a tragic event that led him to be trapped in ice for 100 years, he now has to embark on a journey, with the help of his friends, to find masters who can teach him to master the other three elements: water, earth, and fire. While doing so, he must also face the responsibility of defeating the Fire Nation to restore peace and balance to the world, as they have been stirring trouble and causing war with other nations, and are the reason why Aang is the last Air Nomad today.\nWith that, the reason to why we chose Avatar the Last Airbender as our topic is because we wanted to explore and analyze one of our favorite nostalgic TV shows growing up, as it taught us many important messages in our childhood such as empathy, kindness, love, acceptance, and much more. An example that demonstrates this is the following quote:\n\n\n\n“Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel. You can’t always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving… you will come to a better place.” — Uncle Iroh\nNot only that but given its rise in popularity again due to the Netflix Live Show adaptation, we thought this would be a good topic to explore as the show has caught many people’s attention again. Thus, we hope that the analysis we do will help answer any questions or provide new insights to those watching. With that, the questions that we are interested in studying are the following:\n\nWhich characters spoke the most in the show?\n\nAverage word spoken each episode?\n\nWhich gender had the most lines/word?\n\nHow often do these characters appear through the show?\n\nHow much they appear per season?\n\nWhich episodes/seasons had the highest IMDB rating?",
