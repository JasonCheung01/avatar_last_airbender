# Conclusion 

## Main Takeaways
A few main takeaways that we got from exploring the *`appa`* R package data set 
created by Avery Robbins were primarily: 

1. The importance of each character in Team Avatar and their key role throughout 
the show, as they were consistently among the top 5 on all our analyses about 
characters. Not just that, but the importance of each side character throughout 
the show as they each played a contributing factor to the character's 
development in Team Avatar 

2. The gradual increase of love and popularity of the show, given the increased 
IMDb rating per season, especially for the Fire Book Chapter 

3. The growth and development of each character throughout the show, especially 
Team Avatar, provided each member's increasing interactivity with one another, 
indicating their trust and comfortability of each other

## Limitations 
As for the limitations we faced while exploring the data set, the main one was 
primarily trying to transform one of the graphs to be more readable, 
specifically the graph in Section 3.1.2 on the Results Page. 

Given the many colors involved, we initially wanted to remove the legend and 
add the character’s name as text to the line using a library called gg_repel. 
However, this caused a lot of texts to overlap with one another, given how 
close each of the lines was, and led texts to appear in the middle of the graph. 
Furthermore, we wanted to use a better set of qualitative colors; however, only 
two color palettes from the RColorBrewer package can support more than ten 
colors: “Paired” and “Set3. Unfortunately, these two color palettes were 
unsuitable as they made the lines unreadable, leading us to utilize the default 
color from ggplot2.   

## Future Direction  
Given our limited time constraints, one future direction we would have liked to 
consider is finding another dataset that works well with this dataset containing 
information to further expand our exploration. For example, a dataset that 
includes the following category: 

* Having each character’s gender 
* Location of where characters were during the episodes
* Ratings from another rating platform besides IMDb
* The total number of people who participated in those ratings, or
* Fan favorite characters 

Another future direction is possibly comparing our exploration to Legend of 
Korra, as it is the sequel to Avatar the Last Airbender. Therefore, we can see 
if the two shows are entirely different or similar as they were animated in 
the same universe.

## Lessons Learned 
Having spent a generous amount of time exploring and learning the capability of 
this data set, along with the visualization that we created towards the 
questions we wanted to explore, the main lessons that we learned were:

1. How powerful and purposeful graphs can be, as they can lead to many new 
profound questions and curiosity along the way. For instance, we did not 
initially plan to look at episode appearances for each character. However, 
that changed after seeing the results of the total amount of dialogues each 
character had, leading us to expand from there and discover more analysis on 
the importance and impact of each character. The same case for our exploration 
on interactivity between each character in the show. 

2. Refraining our under-estimation of dense datasets with limited column 
amounts. Initially, we thought we should increase the number of columns for 
this data set as it may make our analysis generic and bland. However, this was 
not the case, as we were able to dive even more deeply than expected as we 
initially thought of including graphs of the show's directors and whether they 
influenced the show's success. But that was not needed, given our curiosity 
towards learning more about our initial questions.
