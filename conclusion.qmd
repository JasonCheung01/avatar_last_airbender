# Conclusion 

## Main Takeaways
A few main takeaways that we got from exploring the *appa* R package data set 
created by Avery Robbins were primarily: 

1. The importance of each character in Team Avatar and their key role throughout 
the show, as they were consistently among the top 5 on all our analyses about 
characters. Not just that, but the importance of each side character throughout 
the show as they each played a contributing factor to the character's 
development in Team Avatar 

2. The gradual increase of love and popularity of the show, given the increased 
IMDb rating per season, especially for the Fire Book Chapter 

3. The growth and development of each character throughout the show, especially 
Team Avatar, provided each member's increasing interactivity with one another, 
indicating their trust and comfortability of each other

## Limitations 
As for the limitations we faced while exploring the data set, the main one was 
primarily trying to transform one of the graphs to be more readable, 
specifically the graph in Section 3.1.2 on the Results Page. 

Given the many colors involved, we initially wanted to remove the legend and 
add the character’s name as text to the line using a library called gg_repel. 
However, this caused a lot of texts to overlap with one another, given how 
close each of the lines was, and led texts to appear in the middle of the graph. 
Furthermore, we wanted to use a better set of qualitative colors; however, only 
two color palettes from the RColorBrewer package can support more than ten 
colors: “Paired” and “Set3. Unfortunately, these two color palettes were 
unsuitable as they made the lines unreadable, leading us to utilize the default 
color from ggplot2.
