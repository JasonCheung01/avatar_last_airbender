# Conclusion 

## Main Takeaways
A few main takeaways that we got from exploring the *`appa`* R package data set 
created by Avery Robbins were primarily: 

1. The importance of each character in Team Avatar and their key role throughout 
the show, as they were consistently among the top 5 on all our analyses about 
characters. Not just that, but the importance of each side character throughout 
the show as they each played a contributing factor to the character's 
development in Team Avatar 

2. The gradual increase of love and popularity of the show, given the increased 
IMDb rating per season, especially for the Fire Book Chapter 

3. The growth and development of each character throughout the show, especially 
Team Avatar, provided each member's increasing interactivity with one another, 
indicating their trust and comfortability of each other

## Limitations/Difficulties  
For the limitations we faced while exploring the data set, it was primarily 
graph transformations for better readability and D3 path issues.

### Graph Transformation Issues  

#### “Top 10 Characters with the Most Lines per Book Chapter” Graph

For the “Top 10 Characters with the Most Lines per Book Chapter” graph in 
Section 3.1.3, to help improve reading the colored lines, we wanted to remove 
the legend and add the character’s name as text to the lines instead by using a 
library called gg_repel. However, this caused issues as many of the texts 
overlapped one another, given how close each line was, and made some texts 
appear in the middle of the graph. 

Additionally, to help improve color readability, we tried to find a better 
qualitative color set from the RColorBrewer package, where we found only two 
color pallets that can support more than 10 colors: “Paired” and “Set3”. 
Unfortunately, this did not help, as the colors used from the two pallets were 
still challenging to read and did not correlate well with our categorical 
“characters” variable. As a result, we decided to use the default colors from 
ggplot2. 

Below is our attempt to do so:

#### “Average Ratings for Characters with Over 15 Appearances Per Episodes” Graph 

For the “Average Ratings for Characters with Over 15 Appearances Per Episodes” 
graph Section 3.2.3, to help improve the interpretability of the circle size, 
we thought using different shapes or setting labels may help. Although we were 
successful in doing so, we were conflicted about these changes. 

For the different shapes, we were debating whether this would help or make the 
reader more confused with the various shapes involved. For the labels, 
although it was clear what each circle represented, it added too much 
unnecessary text to the graph, making it messy. As a result, this led us to 
choose the original graph design.  

Below is the additional graph design created:

### D3 Issues 
#### File Relative Path
To properly load the multiple CSV data files we created for the interactive 
graph, which will work on all branches, we wanted to use a file relative path 
instead of a full hardcoded URL path that was branch-dependent. However, this 
method did not work given how the QMD notebook is rendered and will require 
modification to the YAML file to make it work properly. Thus, a workaround 
instead was to read the current branch name and embed it in the URL so that it 
could properly make the API call to the data file directory.  


## Future Direction  
Given our limited time constraints, one future direction we would have liked to 
consider is finding another dataset that works well with this dataset containing 
information to further expand our exploration. For example, a dataset that 
includes the following category: 

* Having each character’s gender 
* Location of where characters were during the episodes
* Ratings from another rating platform besides IMDb
* The total number of people who participated in those ratings, or
* Fan favorite characters 

Another future direction is possibly comparing our exploration to Legend of 
Korra, as it is the sequel to Avatar the Last Airbender. Therefore, we can see 
if the two shows are entirely different or similar as they were animated in 
the same universe.

## Lessons Learned 
Having spent a generous amount of time exploring and learning the capability of 
this data set, along with the visualization that we created towards the 
questions we wanted to explore, the main lessons that we learned were:

1. How powerful and purposeful graphs can be, as they can lead to many new 
profound questions and curiosity along the way. For instance, we did not 
initially plan to look at episode appearances for each character. However, 
that changed after seeing the results of the total amount of dialogues each 
character had, leading us to expand from there and discover more analysis on 
the importance and impact of each character. The same case for our exploration 
on interactivity between each character in the show. 

2. Refraining our under-estimation of dense datasets with limited column 
amounts. Initially, we thought we should increase the number of columns for 
this data set as it may make our analysis generic and bland. However, this was 
not the case, as we were able to dive even more deeply than expected as we 
initially thought of including graphs of the show's directors and whether they 
influenced the show's success. But that was not needed, given our curiosity 
towards learning more about our initial questions.
