Having now caught your attention with the one and only infamous cabbage man and 
his love for his cabbages, the topic that we chose to explore was Avatar the 
Last Airbender. To those who don't know what Avatar the Last Airbender is, it 
is a show that follows a 13-year-old boy named Aang, who is the last surviving
Air Nomad and Avatar, who has the power to control all elements. However, unable 
to master each of these elements fully before the loss of all predecessor 
Avatars, he now must learn how to master each of them entirely on his own with 
the help of his friends. Additionally, while doing so, he must face the 
responsibility of restoring balance to the world by defeating the Fire nation 
who have launched a century-long assault against other nations, which is a lot 
to take in and do for a 13-year-old boy.  

With that, we chose Avatar the Last Airbender as our topic because we wanted to 
explore and analyze one of our favorite nostalgic TV shows growing up, as it 
taught us many important messages in our childhood such as empathy, kindness, 
love, acceptance, and much more. For instance,

the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving… you will come to a better 
place.” — Uncle Iroh* 

Not only that, but given its rise in popularity again due to Netflix Live 
Show adaptation, we figured this was the best time to explore as it now caught 
many people's attention again, and we hope that our analysis will help answer 
any questions or provide new insights to those watching. With that, the 
questions that we are interested in studying are the following:   

1. Which characters spoke the most in the show?

   - Average word spoken each episode?  
   - Which gender had the most lines/word?

2. How often do these characters appear through the show?

   - How much they appear per season?

3. Which episodes/seasons had the highest IMDB rating?
