If you could recognize this infamous cabbage man and his love for his cabbage, 
then it would be no surprise to you that the topic we chose to discuss was 
Avatar the Last Airbender. 

To keep it brief to those who don't know, Avatar the Last Airbender is a 
television series that focuses on a 12-year-old boy named Aang, who is the last 
surviving Air Nomad and Avatar who is destined to maintain the balance of the 
world and master all four elements: water, earth, fire, and air. However, due 
to a tragic event that led him to be trapped in ice for 100 years, he now has to 
embark on a journey, with the help of his friends, to find masters who can teach 
him to master the other three elements: water, earth, and fire. While doing so, 
he must also face the responsibility of defeating the Fire Nation to restore 
peace and balance to the world, as they have been stirring trouble and causing 
war with other nations, and are the reason why Aang is the last Air Nomad today. 

With that, the reason to why we chose Avatar the Last Airbender as our topic is 
because we wanted to explore and analyze one of our favorite nostalgic TV shows 
growing up, as it taught us many important messages in our childhood such as 
empathy, kindness, love, acceptance, and much more. An example that 
demonstrates this is the following quote:

*“Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel. You can’t always see the light at 
the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving… you will come to a better 
place.” — Uncle Iroh* 

Not only that but given its rise in popularity again due to the Netflix Live 
Show adaptation, we thought this would be a good topic to explore as the show 
has caught many people's attention again. Thus, we hope that the analysis we do 
will help answer any questions or provide new insights to those watching. With 
that, the questions that we are interested in studying are the following:   

1. Which characters spoke the most in the show?

   - Average word spoken each episode?  
   - Which gender had the most lines/word?

2. How often do these characters appear through the show?

   - How much they appear per season?

3. Which episodes/seasons had the highest IMDB rating?
