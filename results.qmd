## How often does Aang speak in the show? What about each season? Does his friends, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Zuko, begin to talk more than him?
### How often does Aang speak in the show?

To begin our analysis on the **`appa` R package** data set created by Avery 
Robbins, we decided first to explore the question of "How often does Aang speak 
in the show? What about each season? Does his friends, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and 
Zuko, begin to talk more than him?" To do this, we decided to get the total 
amount of dialogue spoken by every character throughout the show and focused 
only on the top 10, as there were over 300 characters, including the supporting 
and background characters.

With no surprise, the main characters in Team Avatar, Aang, Katara, Sokka, 
Toph, and Zuko, were among the top 10 with the most dialogues/lines throughout 
the show, where Aang had the most dialogue of about 25%. Thus, answering the 
first part of our question of how often Aang speaks throughout the show. 
Additionally, we can see that the male characters in Team Avatar spoke way more 
than the female characters. The males spoke about 68% of the time in Team Avatar, 
whereas the females spoke about 32%. Lastly, we can see important characters 
like Iroh, Azula, and Suki were among the top 10, which makes sense as each 
played a significant role in some member's development in Team Avatar.

However, one thing about this graph that caught our attention was that side 
characters like Zhao and Jet were among the top 10. This piqued our interest as 
we recall them appearing infrequently in the show. As a result, this made us 
curious where we decided to see how many episodes each of these top 10 
characters with the most dialogues/lines were in.

As you can see, our suspicions about Zhao and Jet appearing infrequently in the 
show were correct. Despite Jet only appearing in 5 and Zhao appearing in 7 
episodes, they still made it among the top 10. What’s even more interesting is 
that we can see characters like Suki, who appeared in more episodes than Jet, 
had fewer dialogues than him by a small amount. Similarly, we can see the same 
case for Toph and Uncle Iroh. Despite Iroh appearing slightly slightly more in 
episodes, Toph still had about 200 more dialogue than him. This was quite a 
surprise as we expected Iroh to have more given the many life lessons and quotes 
he gives to the members of team Avatar, especially Zuko.

All in all, by using the following two graphs together, we can see that the 
majority of the top 10 characters with the most dialogues/lines throughout the 
show are the one who often appear in episodes. This can be seen for Aang, Sokka,
Katara, and Zuko, as they remain in the top 4 in both graphs in the same order. 
Furthermore, with the help of both graphs, we can see a few exceptional cases 
where some of the top 10 characters appearing in fewer episodes have more 
dialogues than those who appear often.  

### What about each season? Does his friends, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Zuko, begin to talk more than him?

## What are the trends of IMDb ratings throughout the show?  
### IMDb Ratings Trend Per Book Chapter  

To discover if there are any trends regarding IMDb ratings for the show, we 
first grabbed all the episode names, episode number,and their IMDb rating where 
we then faceted over their respective book or season and got the following: 

![IMDb Rating of each episode Per Chapter Book](images/graphs/avatar_show_imdb_rating_per_book.png)

From this, we can see the trend of each episode with respect to their chapter 
book. Starting with Water Book or Season 1, we can see a lot of fluctuation 
going on where in the first 7 episodes, it was consistent where it was between 
8 - 8.5 IMDb rating. Afterward, it kept going up and down from episodes 8-17 
between 7 - 9.1, and then, for the last few episodes, it went up slowly to 9.3. 
Unfortunately, as mentioned in the “Missing” section, we are missing one 
episode, which is the last episode in the water book chapter.

Next, Earth Book or Season 2, starts with a lot of fluctuation for the first 
12 episodes, with a rating between 7.5 and 9.5. Afterward, the fluctuation 
becomes slowly consistent, where it jumps up and down each episode, leading to 
the last episode having an IMDb rating of 9.6. Lastly, Fire Book or Season 3, 
goes through way more fluctuation compared to the first two season where the 
first 17 episodes drastically keeps jumping from rating between 7.8 and 9.5. 
However, this began to change in the last 4 episodes, where the fluctuation 
then began to only increase, leading the last episode to have a 9.8 rating. 

Overall, these three-faceted graphs are helpful for those curious to see rating 
fluctuation for each book chapter and to see each episode's impact on each book 
chapter as well. The only downside is that comparing episode ratings with other 
episodes in different chapters can be challenging despite the three-faceted 
graphs being on the same scale.   

### IMDb Ratings of all Episodes Colored by Book Chapter  

![IMDb Rating of all Episodes in Order](images/graphs/avatar_show_imdb_rating_all_episode.png)

To resolve the above graph challenge of comparing episode ratings with other 
Book Chapters, we created a Cleveland dot plot where we displayed all the 
episode names, sorted them based on the IMDb rating in descending order, and 
colored each one to their corresponding chapter. With this, we can now easily 
compare all episodes in each season simultaneously.  

For example, we can see that most episodes with higher IMDb ratings come from 
the Fire Book Chapter, whereas episodes with lower IMDb ratings come from the 
Water Book Chapter. Furthermore, we can see that episodes from the Earth Book 
Chapter had evenly distributed IMDb ratings. Some were in the lower end with 
episodes from the Water Book Chapter, some were in the middle, and some were in 
the higher end with episodes from the Fire Book Chapter. Lastly, we can see 
gradual changes in the IMDb rating, which generally increases as we progress 
through each chapter, from Water to Earth and then Fire, indicating improvement 
in the story as it begins to capture more of the audience's or viewers' 
attention. 

All in all, with the help of the Cleveland Dot plot, we were able to quickly 
form comparisons regarding all the episode IMDB ratings in each book chapter 
and gain further observation and insight about them, which would not have been 
possible or rather tricky with just the three-faceted graph alone.
