Graph to see how often each of the main cast interact with one another  
(We can probably use this data for our D3 graph where can let user hover each 
main character to see amount of interaction with other main character)

```{r}
character_interaction <- 
  unique_avatar_character |> 
  select(book, character, character_words) 

character_interaction
```

```{r}
# This is our interpretation of who we believe are truly the main characters 
# for this show while the others are supporting characters 
main_cast <- c('Aang', 'Sokka', 'Katara', 'Zuko', 'Toph')
main_cast
```

```{r}
# Following code below was from the help of GPT  

# Create a single regex pattern for main cast members
main_cast_pattern <- paste0("\\b(", paste(main_cast, collapse = "|"), ")\\b")

# Process interactions
interaction_counts <- character_interaction |>
  mutate(mentioned = str_extract_all(character_words, main_cast_pattern)) |>  
  unnest(mentioned) |>
  filter(character %in% main_cast, mentioned %in% main_cast, character != mentioned) |> 
  mutate(pair = pmap_chr(list(character, mentioned), ~ paste(sort(c(...)), collapse = " - "))) |> 
  count(pair, name = "frequency") |>
  separate(pair, into = c("character1", "character2"), sep = " - ") 

interaction_counts
```
The problem with this approach is that some characters can have interaction without explicitly saying the other character name. And in some cases, the character can use a nickname. To solve this problem, we will measure interaction between characters if they share a scene.

```{r}
avatar_scene <- read.csv("avatar_data_scene.csv", header = TRUE) 
avatar_character_scene <- avatar_scene |>
  select(book, chapter, chapter_num, character, character_words,scene_id) 

unique_avatar_character_scene <- avatar_character_scene[!duplicated(avatar_character_scene), ]

unique_avatar_character_scene |> head()
```

```{r}
unique_avatar_character_scene <- unique_avatar_character_scene %>%
  group_by(scene_id) %>%
  mutate(
    scene_characters = paste(sort(unique(character[!is.na(character)])), collapse = ", "),
    num_characters_scene=length(unique(character[!is.na(character)]))) %>%
  ungroup()
unique_avatar_character_scene |> head()
```
```{r}
unique_avatar_character_scene$book <-
  fct_relevel(unique_avatar_character_scene$book, "Water")
unique_avatar_character_scene |> head()
```



```{r}
# this data frame measure the interactions between characters where a set of character have an interaction if they share a scene 
# entirety of show 
interactions <- unique_avatar_character_scene |> 
  group_by(scene_characters,num_characters_scene) |> 
  summarise(frequency = n(),.groups = 'drop') |> 
  arrange(desc(frequency)) |> 
  ungroup()

```{r}
